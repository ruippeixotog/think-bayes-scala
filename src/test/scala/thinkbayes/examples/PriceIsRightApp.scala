/** Application for studying the The Price is Right problem (page 51):
  *
  * "On November 1, 2007, contestants named Letia and Nathaniel appeared on The Price is Right, an American game show.
  * They competed in a game called The Showcase, where the objective is to guess the price of a showcase of prizes. The
  * contestant who comes closest to the actual price of the showcase, without going over, wins the prizes.
  *
  * Nathaniel went first. His showcase included a dishwasher, a wine cabinet, a laptop computer, and a car. He bid
  * \$26,000.
  *
  * Letia’s showcase included a pinball machine, a video arcade game, a pool table, and a cruise of the Bahamas. She bid
  * \$21,500.
  *
  * The actual price of Nathaniel’s showcase was \$25,347. His bid was too high, so he lost.
  *
  * The actual price of Letia’s showcase was \$21,578. She was only off by \$78, so she won her showcase and, because
  * her bid was off by less than \$250, she also won Nathaniel’s showcase.
  *
  * For a Bayesian thinker, this scenario suggests several questions: <ol> <li>Before seeing the prizes, what prior
  * beliefs should the contestant have about the price of the showcase?</li> <li>After seeing the prizes, how should the
  * contestant update those beliefs?</li> <li>Based on the posterior distribution, what should the contestant bid?</li>
  * </ol>"
  *
  * Note: this application requires the files "showcases.2011.csv" and "showcases.2012.csv" to be in the root folder of
  * the project. The files are available at [[http://thinkbayes.com/showcases.2011.csv]] and
  * [[http://thinkbayes.com/showcases.2012.csv]].
