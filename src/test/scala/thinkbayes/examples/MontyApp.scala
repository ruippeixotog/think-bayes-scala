/** Application for solving the Monty Hall problem (page 7):
  *
  * "Monty Hall was the original host of the game show Let’s Make a Deal. The Monty Hall problem is based on one of the
  * regular games on the show. If you are on the show, here’s what happens:
  *
  * <ul> <li>Monty shows you three closed doors and tells you that there is a prize behind each door: one prize is a
  * car, the other two are less valuable prizes like peanut butter and fake finger nails. The prizes are arranged at
  * random.</li> <li>The object of the game is to guess which door has the car. If you guess right, you get to keep the
  * car.</li> <li>You pick a door, which we will call Door A. We’ll call the other doors B and C. Before opening the
  * door you chose, Monty increases the suspense by opening either Door B or C, whichever does not have the car. (If the
  * car is actually behind Door A, Monty can safely open B or C, so he chooses one at random.)</li> <li>Then Monty
  * offers you the option to stick with your original choice or switch to the one remaining unopened door.</li> </ul>
  *
  * The question is, should you “stick” or “switch” or does it make no difference?"
