/** Application for solving the Dungeons and Dragons d6 problem (page 42):
  *
  * "The first example is based on Dungeons & Dragons, a role-playing game where the results of players’ decisions are
  * usually determined by rolling dice. In fact, before game play starts, players generate each attribute of their
  * characters—strength, intelligence, wisdom, dexterity, constitution, and charisma—by rolling three 6-sided dice and
  * adding them up.
  *
  * So you might be curious to know the distribution of this sum."
