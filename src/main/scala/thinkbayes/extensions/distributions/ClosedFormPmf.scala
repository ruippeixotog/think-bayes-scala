/** Trait of `Pmf` instances whose probability value is calculated by a closed-form expression and, as such, do not
  * allow freely adding, removing or modifying outcomes and probabilities. Such operations create and return a new
  * categorical distribution reflecting the changes.
  *
  * Typically, implementations of `ClosedFormPmf` also have a closed-form expression for calculating their numerical
  * mean. If that is the case, they are expected to override `mean` to provide an efficient implementation.
